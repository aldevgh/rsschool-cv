## Personal Profile:

Hi! My name is Alexandra. I am 24 years old. For 4 years I've been working for state educational institution in Minsk. My work is related to the organization of training in additional education. 

The daily routine, meager wages, bureaucracy and lack of career opportunities disappointed me, so I decided to change my field of activity. 

I found my interest in Web Development and Design, so currently I am taking the first steps to become a  Frontend Developer. 

I am extremely motivated to constantly develop my skills and grow professionally.
